        <p>Hello everyone, Namaste!</p>
        <p>Welcome to my first blog post! Today, I want to share some insights into the monthly cost of living in London as an international student. This guide will help you understand what to expect and plan your budget accordingly. So, let’s dive right in!</p>

        <h2>1. Rent</h2>
        <p>The first and often the largest expense is rent. Living in Central London can be quite pricey, so if you're looking to save some money, consider finding accommodation further from the city center. London is divided into different zones, with Zone 1 being the most expensive and Zones 2 and 3 being relatively cheaper.</p>
        <p>As a student, sharing a room can significantly reduce your rent. I personally live in Zone 3, where the average monthly rent ranges from £600 to £700. However, if you’re sharing a room, you can expect to pay around £300 to £350 per month, which includes electricity and Wi-Fi bills. Just keep in mind that energy prices in the UK have been rising, so your expenses might increase a bit.</p>

        <h2>2. Transport Costs</h2>
        <p>As students, we often find ourselves commuting to university and work frequently. The primary modes of transport in London are buses and the Underground (tube) trains. A bus journey costs £1.65, and you can travel free for one hour after that. The daily cap on bus fares is around £5. If you use trains, prices vary based on your destination, but on average, you can expect to spend about £100 to £150 per month on transportation.</p>

        <h2>3. Grocery Shopping</h2>
        <p>Grocery bills can be a significant part of your monthly expenses, especially if you enjoy cooking. I highly recommend cooking at home, as eating out can be quite costly for students. The average monthly expenditure for groceries is around £150 to £200. If you're living with a roommate, you can always split the grocery bill, making it more affordable for both of you.</p>

        <h2>4. Eating Out and Drinks</h2>
        <p>If you enjoy dining out or ordering food through apps like Uber Eats, you should budget for it as well. On average, a meal out or an order might cost you at least £20. Depending on how often you eat out, your monthly expenses for dining can range from £100 to £200, especially if you occasionally buy food at work.</p>

        <h2>5. Extra Expenses</h2>
        <p>Extra expenses include various activities like visiting attractions, buying clothes, purchasing gifts, subscriptions (like Netflix or Prime), medicines, and household necessities. The average for these additional costs can be around £50 per month, but it can easily exceed that based on your lifestyle.</p>

        <h2>In Total</h2>
        <p>Let’s sum up all these expenses to get a clearer picture of the average monthly expenditure for international students in London. If you share your accommodation, your total monthly costs will likely be around £700 to £800. However, if you choose to live alone, you might find yourself spending between £900 to £1,000 per month.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>That wraps up my overview of the monthly expenses for international students living in London. I hope this blog helps you plan your budget better!
